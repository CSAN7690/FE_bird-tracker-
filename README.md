📚 Project Bio

The Bird Tracker App was designed to help urban bird rehabilitators keep tabs on birds they rescue and release back into the wild. Every bird tells a story, and through this app, you can document that journey—from the moment you find them injured to the moment they’re ready to return to their natural habitat.

Central Park, city streets, and rooftop gardens—these places are filled with feathered friends who need a little help from us humans now and then. Use this app to catalog each encounter and celebrate their return to freedom.
